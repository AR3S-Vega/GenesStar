            description = Vukan was the first planet to be discovered due to its proximity to Gene's Star. It was named after the ancient god of Firey Death since the temperatures can get somewhat extreme, definitley not the best for tourist revenue. It is highly recommended that you bring your heatshields and radiators here if want even a slim chance of setting up something in its orbit, ice is not required.
