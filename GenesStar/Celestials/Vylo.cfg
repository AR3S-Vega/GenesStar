			description = Vylo is one of the planets that fill the void between Himos and Duenus, the other being Agustin. When first observed, it appeared to have a strange copper-like surface with several impact marks not so visible. There have been amy profound theories as to why it shines and looks like copper in a sphere, from a bunch of copper-filled asteroids to being a giant lighting attractor. Either way, it still holds a prospect for future mining companies to go and fly out to Vylo, if you don't mind the planet having half of the gravity of Kerbin. The white patches on its dark side are ice. DEVS NOTE: Vylo is planned for a rework in a later update. Don't settle too much there.
